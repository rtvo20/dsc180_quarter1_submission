# Quarter 1 Project:
Using data from David Fenning's SOLEIL lab that creates solar cell samples, this project cleans and transforms the data, which is originally stored in a JSON file, into CSVs that allow it to be graphed in a Graph DBMS, Neo4j. The purpose of this task is to organize the data so that it is queryable.

This current iteration includes test data under test/testdata that is one sample of the data to show how our code works on that sample.

## To run the project, use run.py.
