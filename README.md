# Quarter 1 Project:
Using data from a lab that creates solar cell samples, this project cleans and transforms the data, which is originally stored in a JSON file, into CSVs that allow it to be graphed in a Graph DBMS, Neo4j. The purpose of this task is to organize the data so that it can be queryable.
